Save me from drowning in the sea
Beat me up on the beach
What a lovely holiday, there's nothing funny left to say

This sombre song would drain the sun
But it won't shine until it's sung
No water running in the stream, the saddest place we've ever seen

Everything I touched was golden
Everything I loved got broken
On the raod to Mandalay

Every mistake I've ever made
Has been rehashed and then replayed
As I got lost along the way

Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
Bom badom
